AntVM
=====

This project is a tiny size virtual machine which is designed to
have tiny size and support most of necessary and useful features.

What it can / can't do at this point
==========================

x86 architecture will be supported first. AntVM is supposed to 
run on windows and linux. The first simulated OS is linux. UART
will be the first supported hardware.
It's just an init version now. Everything is in design stage.
